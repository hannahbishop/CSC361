#Description
SmartClient.py is a command line web client that collects information about a web server

#Run
To run the program:
    $ python3 smartclient.py <host>
For example:
    $ python3 smartclient.py www.uvic.ca 
    or
    $ python3 smartclient.py www2.gov.bc.ca

#Other information
This program was built to run using Python3.6 and higher.
There will be a small delay between execution and output, 
while the client queries the server and decodes the response.
